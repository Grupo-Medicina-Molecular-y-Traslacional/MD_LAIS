                ToMoCoMD-CAMPS MD-LAIs software computes algebraic form-based 0/1-D molecular descriptors for peptide/protein sequences.
            </p>                         
            <p>
                This version has some relevant features, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One chemical input format (FASTA files)</li>                
                <li>Three output file formats: Space Delimited Text file, Weka ARFF file and Comma-Separated Values file.</li>                
                <li>Thirty-nine properties as amino-acid weightings: side-chain mass, volume, Qubils-MIDAS, MD-LOVIS scales and so on</li>                
                 <li>Amino acid weights based on fuzzy membership functions (lg st)</li>
                <li>Thirty local indices clasified into three categories: amino-acid type, secondary structure preference and R groups</li> 
                <li>8400 local based on k-mers (dipeptides and tripeptides)</li> 
                <li>Several aggregation operators (AOs) that generalize the initial form of obtaining indices from amino acidic 
                    (or fragment) contributions; the new indices are obtained by using these AOs over the LAIs (Local Amino acidic Invariants
                    ) vector that include amino acidic indices</li>
                <li> A module to compute descriptors from their headings</li>
                <li> A module for descriptor selection based on Shannon Entropy and Pearson (or Spearman) Correlation</li>
                <li> Calculations with enhanced speed by using of all CPU cores</li>
            </ul>
