                CAMD-BIR Unit provides an informatics infrastructure to the chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical investigations. Our research groupâ€™s suite of Chem-Bio-Informatics applications covers many different areas using modern methods of molecular (drug) design. The research is devoted to the development of novel computational methods, to handling of chemical information, to database mining for hit and lead structure search, to the generation of pharmacophore models for the design of new bio-active compounds. Some in-house software systems also addressing the needs of today's research disciplines including QSAR/QSPR studies, protein modeling, structure and ligand-based design, high throughput discovery, molecular modeling and simulations,Virtual Molecular Screening (mining HTS and eHTS data for compound selection).

                Currently, one of CAMD-BIR Unit core strength is the definition of new molecular and macromolecular descriptors and the biosilico discovery of novel chemical entities (NCE) as well as early pharmacokinetics (ADME), PhysChem and toxicity prediction. In addition, CAMD-BIR Unit is leveraging its know-how and proprietary technology to expand its research activities in the area of docking and scoring functions (mainly new structure-based drug design approaches), protein homology, Protein-protein interactions, computer-aided synthesis design, planning of organic reactions, synthesis driven combinatorial library design and prediction of synthetic accessibility of compounds. The research group offers its products and services to several investigation team, departments and companies worldwide.

                The key aim of the CAMD-BIR Unit is the development and application of integrative Chem-bio-informatics methods to support this wet-dry cycle, and combined bioinformatics and chemo-informatics methods to support modern drug discovery. CAMD-BIR Unit was founded by Prof. Dr. Yovani Marrero Ponce as a spin-off of the Department of Pharmacy (Faculty of Chemistry & Pharmacy) at the Central University of Las Villas (UCLV).
