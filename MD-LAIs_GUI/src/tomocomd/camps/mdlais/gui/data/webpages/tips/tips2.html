            <p><b>What is MD-LAIs</b></p>
            <p>
                The MD-LAIs’ system (v1.0) allows an easy calculation of sequence-based protein descriptors. They are based on the application of aggregation operator over a vector of LAIs. This version has some relevant features, such as:
                <li>One chemical input format (FASTA files)</li> 
                <li>A sub module for the curation of fasta files to perform calculations</li>
                <li>Thirty-nine properties as amino acid weightings: Mass, Volume, Z-scale, MD-LOVIs, QuBils-MIDAS scales and son on.</li>
                <li>A fuzzy-weighted ponderation based on the position of amino acids in the sequence(lg st)</li>
                <li>Thirty local indices classified into in three categories: Amino-Acid type: Apolar, Polar positively charged, Polar negatively charged and so on, Secondary Structure Preference: Alpha helix favoring Amino-Acids, Beta-Sheets favoring Amino-Acids and so on and R group (one for each α-aminoacid) including Alanine, Arginine and so on. </li>                
                <li>Three output file formats, Space Delimited Text file, Weka ARFF file and Comma Separated Values file.</li>                
                <li>Several aggregation operators that generalize the initial form of obtaining indices from amino acidic (or fragment) contributions; the new indices are obtained by aplying these operators over LAIs (Local Amino Acidic Invariants) vector that include amino acidic indices</li>
                <li>Calculations with enhanced speed by using of all CPU cores</li>
