            <p><b>CAMD-BIR Unit</b> provides an informatics infrastructure to the chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical investigations. 
                Our research groupâ€™s suite of <b>Chem-Bio-Informatics</b> applications covers many different areas using modern methods of molecular (drug) design. 
                The research is devoted to the development of novel computational methods, to handling of chemical information, to database mining for hit and 
                lead structure search, to the generation of pharmacophore models for the design of new bio-active compounds. 
                Some in-house software systems also addressing the needs of today's research disciplines including <b>QSAR/QSPR</b> studies, protein modeling, 
                structure and ligand-based design, high throughput discovery, molecular modeling and simulations,Virtual Molecular Screening 
                (mining HTS and eHTS data for compound selection).
