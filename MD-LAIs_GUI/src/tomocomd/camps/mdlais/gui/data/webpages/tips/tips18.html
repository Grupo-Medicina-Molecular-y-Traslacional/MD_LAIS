            <p>Over the years, it has been generally accepted that the definition of global (or local) indices from LOVIs (Local Vertex Invariants),called here LAIs (Local Amino Acid Invariants),
               implies the summation of the contributions of the elements that constitute a given molecule (or graph). However, 
               summation (Minskowskiâ€™s first norm (N1) in our specific case) is just one of the many <b>aggregation operators</b> capable of globally characterizing given LAIs. 
               In this program, we introduce a series of aggregation operators that generalize the traditional method of obtaining global (or local) invariants by summation of 
               the LAIs. These are classified in six major groups: </p>
            <p>1) Norms (or Metrics), </p>
            <p>2) Mean (first statistical moment), </p>
            <p>3) Statistical (highest statistical moments), </p>
            <p>4) Information Theory,</p>
            <p>5) Classical algorithms.</p>            
            <p>6) Other.</p>
