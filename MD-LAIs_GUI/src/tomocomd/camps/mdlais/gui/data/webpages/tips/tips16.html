            <p>In addition to total bilinear three-linear and four-linear indices computed for the whole molecule, a local-fragment (atomic, group or atom-type) 
                formalism can be developed. These descriptors are termed, for example, local non-stochastic quadratic indices. 
                It should be pointed out also that for every partitioning of a molecule into Z molecular fragments there will be Z local molecular fragment matrices. 
                In this case, if a molecule is partitioned into Z molecular fragments, the matrix Mk [Sk] can be partitioned into Z 
                local matrices MkL [SkL], L = 1,... Z, and the kth power of matrix M is exactly the sum of the kth power of the local Z matrices and consequently, 
                the total non-stochastic quadratic indices are the sum of the non-stochastic quadratic indices of the Z molecular fragments. Atomic, 
                atom-type and group quadratic indices are specific cases of local quadratic indices. In general, seven Local Indices are implemented in this 
                software. In the case that no local index is selected, only total indices will be calculated.
