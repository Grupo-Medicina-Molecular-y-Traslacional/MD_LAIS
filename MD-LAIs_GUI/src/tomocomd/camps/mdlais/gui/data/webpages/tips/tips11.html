            <p>One kind of indices can be computed by MuLiMs Software: 1) atom-based indices, and 2) bond-level descriptors. The main difference between these two classes of descriptors is the relations between elements of the molecular graph. In the first type, the relation is over a pair of atoms and in the second type, the adjacency relation is at an edge level. QUBILs-MIDAS and QUBILs-POMAS only uses atomic relations.</p>
