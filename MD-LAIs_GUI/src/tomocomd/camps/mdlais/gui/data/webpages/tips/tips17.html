                The local or total indices can be calculated taking into consideration all elements in matrices of algebraic forms [KA (Keep All]. However, the software avails other 
                options in cutoff. LG. The lag assumes values between 1 and L. The idea of a lag is taken from autocorrelation descriptors, only that here the meaning is quite different. This cutoff is applied to the elements in the matrices for the algebraic forms. 
                In this software, a range of k values will be used instead of only one value of k, e.g., k= 2-5, k=2;4;7-9.
                o LG[p] (lag p). In this lag the maximum value L can be n â€“ 1, where n is the number of amino acids. When this lag is applied, the matrix elements are different from zero for relations of amino acids that have at least a topological distance, p, equal to a specified k value.
