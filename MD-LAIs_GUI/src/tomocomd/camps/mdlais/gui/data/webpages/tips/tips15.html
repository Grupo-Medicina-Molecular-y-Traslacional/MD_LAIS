            <p>The total and local quadratic, bilinear, and linear indices, as defined in their “standard” form in QUBILs modules,
                cannot codify any information about chirality. In order to solve this problem,
                we introduced a trigonometric 3D-chirality correction factor in a molecular vector
                [atomic (or bond level) property based molecular vector] X .
                In this sense, a chirality molecular vector is obtained (*X ), where the components of X
                (for instance, Pauling electronegativity (Xa) of the atom A) are substituted by the following term
                [Xa + sin ((Wa+4d)PI/2)]. See more details in help section/theory.
